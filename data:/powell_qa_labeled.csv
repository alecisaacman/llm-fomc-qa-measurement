"So much of the rationale for cutting interest rates, even as inflation moves away from the 2 percent target, seems to be that there are these mounting downside risks to the labor market. But if those don’t materialize and the labor market either stabilizes around current employment levels or even starts to strengthen somewhat, how would that change your perception of how much interest rates need to fall from here? Would you then be a bit more concerned about underlying inflation and the possibility of second-round effects from tariffs?","Yeah, I mean in principle if you were to see data that suggested that the labor market is strengthening or even that it’s stabilizing, that would certainly play into our decisions going forward.","Question: So much of the rationale for cutting interest rates, even as inflation moves away from the 2 percent target, seems to be that there are these mounting downside risks to the labor market.

"So there’s a big investment boom in AI infrastructure right now, as you know, and wondering if the existence of such a boom would indicate that rates are not that restrictive after all, and could further rate cuts at this point perhaps fuel an excess level of investment there or market bubbles?

"Have these disagreements complicated your role presiding over the FOMC meetings? And, if so, how?","I wouldn’t say that, no. I think you—you have to take what comes, and what comes right now is a pretty challenging situation where we have—first of all, we have 4.3 percent unemployment, we have an economy that’s growing close to 2 percent.

And if we do wind up resuming rate cuts at some point—we will at some point—I think we’re trying to get to the end of this cycle with the labor market in a good place and with inflation on its way to 2 percent or at 2 percent. So that’s all we’re trying to do, and we’re doing it under quite challenging circumstances and doing the best we can.",1,0,2,2,2,1
I’m curious how the Fed is looking at these loan losses and if it poses risks to the financial system or the outlook for the economy. Is it a warning sign?,"So, we’re—obviously we watch these things very carefully, credit conditions very carefully. You’re right—you’ve seen rising defaults in subprime credit for some time now, and now you’ve seen a number of subprime credit—automobile credit institutions having significant losses, and some of those losses are now showing up on the books of banks. We’re looking at it carefully, we’re paying close attention. I don’t see, at this point, a broader credit issue. It doesn’t seem to be something that has very broad application across financial institutions. But we’re going to be—we’re going to be monitoring this quite carefully and making sure that that is the case.","Question: I’m curious how the Fed is looking at these loan losses and if it poses risks to the financial system or the outlook for the economy.

"How much of consumer spending continuing hinges on the stock market remaining strong? In some odd way, does the market help keep the economy buoyant?","So there is some—there is some relationship there, but, remember, the more wealth someone has, the lower an additional dollar of wealth matters. So your marginal propensity to consume declines quite dramatically as you reach—as you reach levels of stock market wealth. So the stock market—it would affect spending if the stock market went down, but it wouldn’t drop—it wouldn’t drop sharply unless there were quite a sharp drop in the stock market. People at the lower end of income and wealth have a much higher marginal propensity to consume an incremental dollar of income or wealth, but they don’t have the stock market wealth. So I think it’s certainly a factor supporting consumption right now, but—and you would see it if you saw material corrections in spending. But it wouldn’t be—you shouldn’t think that it’ll, dollar for dollar, stop consumption, because that wouldn’t be the case.","Question: How much of consumer spending continuing hinges on the stock market remaining strong?
